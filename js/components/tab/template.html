  <h2>2. Functions</h2>
  <p>Great job, test! In JavaScript, when we surround a word with quotes it's called a string, and when we're done with a line of code we finish it with a semicolon.</p>
  <p>JavaScript also has built-in features, called functions. In order to call a function, we simply write its name (this time without quotes) and end it with a set of parentheses. Try calling the alert function as you see below.</p>
  <p>Don't be afraid when a box pops up â€” that's your code working, test!</p>
